## Implementing algorithm C4.5 to generate Decision Trees using MapReduce and Spark

We used the C4.5 Algorithm to create decision trees by making Map-Reduce functions to calculate the Gain Ratio. 
Further, we also implemented it on spark, using the Python API of Spark framework. Our primary objective is to compare the execution times of 
building decision trees on both frameworks on different sizes of datasets. The dataset of the Lymphography Domain was used in our experiment.
